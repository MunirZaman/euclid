Welcome to Euclid's documentation!
==================================

``euclid`` is a project of mine that I've been working on for the past few months. It's a set of python scripts 
that lets you do analytic geometry in ``python``. You can also draw TikZ diagrams using ``tikz_draw.py``. 
**It's a work in progress.** 

The following python packages are required to use ``euclid``,

* `numpy <https://pypi.org/project/numpy/>`_
* `scipy <https://pypi.org/project/scipy/>`_
* `sympy <https://pypi.org/project/sympy/>`_
* `pdf2image <https://pypi.org/project/pdf2image/>`_
* `Pillow <https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/>`_

To use ``tikz_draw.py`` you have to have ``LaTeX`` and ``tikz`` package installed.
